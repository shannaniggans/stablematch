- If a practitioner sets up a client for themselves, that should stay local to their account only, but also have the option to link with a profile, so for example if the client already has a profile set up, the practitioner can request to view their profile, with either phone or email. 


- Ability for a practitioner to send an online waiver and have it signed by the client and stored in both profiles

- Reminder system for appointments but also check ups - "it's been 12 months since your saddle was last fitted"
